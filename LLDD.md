# Low Level Design Document (LLDD)

## Implementation Details
1. Use a Nostr library (e.g., `nostr-js`) to connect to Nostr relays and fetch notes.
2. Implement PoW calculation based on Nostr's PoW algorithm.
3. Use a frontend framework (e.g., React, Vue) to create the UI.
4. Sort notes using a sorting algorithm (e.g., JavaScript's built-in `sort()`).

## Data Structures
1. Note object: `{ id, content, pow }`

## Algorithms
1. PoW Calculation: Implement the PoW algorithm as specified in Nostr protocol.
2. Sorting: Use JavaScript's `sort()` function to sort notes by their PoW.

## Task Checklist
1. Set up the project structure.
2. Implement Nostr relay connection and note fetching.
3. Implement PoW calculation for notes.
4. Implement sorting of notes by PoW.
5. Create the UI to display sorted notes with their PoW.
6. Build the project into a deployable format.
7. Use `@nsyte/cli` to deploy the client to Nostr and Blossom servers.
