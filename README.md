# Nsite Setup and Deployment Guide

## Overview
This guide provides step-by-step instructions on setting up and deploying an nsite using `@nsyte/cli`.

## Prerequisites
1. Install Deno on your system.
2. Create a new directory for your project and navigate into it.

## Step 1: Configure and Deploy `@nsyte/cli`
Run the following command to deploy your site:
```bash
deno run -A jsr:@nsyte/cli upload ./
```
Follow the interactive prompts to configure your Nostr key and other settings.

## Example Configuration
- User: `cef7e35e8eba726ef5189a6703b975b304ab7fa6dd16d3f381464c2e3c33f6cc`
- Relays: `wss://relay.nostr.band`, `wss://nos.lol`, `wss://relay.damus.io`
- Servers: `https://cdn.hzrd149.com/`, `https://cdn.sovbit.host/`

## Deployment
After configuration, `@nsyte/cli` will upload your files to the specified servers and publish the necessary information to Nostr relays.

## Accessing Your Nsite
Your nsite will be available on any nsite gateway, for example:
```
https://npub1t3fkvr55sw6qvlrrutasq466qmr0qa08ectdd0jexqudhhe6npdq5thtln.nsite.lol/
```

## Understanding Nsite Operation
The nsite is a static site generated by `nostr-client.mjs`. When you access the nsite through an nsite gateway, you are viewing a pre-generated HTML file (`index.html`). The JavaScript code in `nostr-client.mjs` runs on the server-side or locally during development to fetch Nostr events, calculate PoW, sort notes, and generate the static `index.html`. The nsite does not execute JavaScript client-side to fetch or process Nostr events in real-time; it serves static content that was pre-generated.

## Design Documents
1. [High Level Design Document (HLDD)](HLDD.md)
2. [Low Level Design Document (LLDD)](LLDD.md)

## Implementation Status
- [x] Set up the project structure.
- [x] Implement Nostr relay connection and note fetching.
- [x] Implement PoW calculation for notes.
- [x] Implement sorting of notes by PoW.
- [x] Create the UI to display sorted notes with their PoW.
- [x] Build the project into a deployable format.
- [x] Deploy the client to Nostr and Blossom servers using `@nsyte/cli`.
